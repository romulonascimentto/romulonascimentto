As a Data Analyst with over 4 years of experience, I have developed a keen eye for detail and a storytelling approach to data. My career began in financial industry, where I learned the importance of accuracy and the power of data to drive strategic decisions. I have since transitioned into the tech industry, where I apply these principles to analyze user behavior and improve product offerings.

My expertise lies in transforming raw data into compelling narratives that inform and influence business strategy. I am proficient in a variety of tools including SQL, Python, Power BI and MS Excel Advanced (DAX, Power Query, Power Pivot), which I use to uncover trends and patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. My work has directly contributed to optimizing marketing strategies and enhancing customer retention. I also have experience with system migration projects, working with Data Preparation and Validation, and currently, I am working to upskill in Data Engineering.

Here's how I can currently assist you:

• Statistics Analysis (Python, MS Excel)
• Data Visualization: Build KPI's, Reports & Dashboards. (Power BI).
• Data Preparation, Data Analysis (Python, SQL, Excel, PowerBI, SQL Server, Azure)
